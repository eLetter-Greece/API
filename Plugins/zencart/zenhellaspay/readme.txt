Linked Wallet - link the payment source to the wallet you want to use with it

Integration method - redirection
Company Logo - your png company logo to display on the Vivawallet payment page
Success URL - as described in the plugin instructions

Wait until Vivawallet has activated your newly created Payment Source before activating the plugin in your e-commerce platform.
